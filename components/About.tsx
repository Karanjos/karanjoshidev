            I&apos;m a passionate, self-proclaimed developer who specializes in
            full stack development (React.js & Node.js). I am very enthusiastic
            about bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products
            to life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and writing clear,
            readable, highly performant code matters to me.
          </p>

            I began my journey in 2024, and since then, I&apos;ve continued to
            grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and
            learning the latest technologies along the way. I&apos;m building
            cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies such as
            Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwindcss, Node.js and much more.
          </p>

            I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products
            end to end, from ideation all the way to development.

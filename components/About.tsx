              <p>
                I&apos;m a passionate, self-proclaimed developer who specializes
                in full stack development (React.js & Node.js). I am very
                enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual aspects of
                digital products to life. User experience, pixel perfect design,
                and writing clear, readable, highly performant code matters to
                me.
              </p>
              <p>
                I began my journey in 2024, and since then, I've continued to
                grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and
                learning the latest technologies along the way. I'm building
                cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies such as
                Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwindcss, Node.js and much more.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on
                products end to end, from ideation all the way to development.
